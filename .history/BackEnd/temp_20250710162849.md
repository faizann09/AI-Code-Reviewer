❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a + b ;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined as parameters to the function. This means they will be looked up in the scope chain, and
if not found, will result in an error in strict mode or implicit global variable creation in non-strict mode.
* ❌ The function doesn't have any input parameters, so it's not clear what values should be added together.
* ❌ There are no JSDoc comments.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
/**
* Sums two numbers together.
*
* @param {number} a The first number.
* @param {number} b The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of a and b.
*/
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ The function now accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which represent the numbers to be added.
* ✔️ JSDoc comments have been added explaining what the function does, what parameters it accepts, and what it returns.
* ✔️ The function returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
